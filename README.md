## Automate the Setup with Our Interactive Ubuntu Setup Script

### Why Use the Setup Script?

Setting up a fresh Ubuntu installation can be tedious, especially when you have to install all the necessary software and configure settings manually. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were an automated way to take care of all the basic setup steps in just a few minutes?

Enter our **Interactive Ubuntu Setup Script**! This script automates the installation of essential software, sets up security features, and personalizes your desktop environment—all with a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive prompts**: You’ll be asked whether you want to install specific tools or features, such as Docker, web browsers, communication tools, or security settings.
- **Customizable**: Only install what you need! Choose between different options (e.g., browsers, development tools, media players, etc.) as the script runs.
- **Easy-to-use**: No need to remember complex commands—just run the script, answer a few questions, and let it do the rest.
- **Well-organized**: The script is divided into logical sections with clear headings and separators, making the installation process easy to follow.
